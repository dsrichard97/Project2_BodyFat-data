## Introduction
The United States faces a myriad of health challenges, ranging from rising obesity rates to increasing incidences of chronic diseases. Understanding these challenges requires a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of health and nutritional data. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) offers a rich dataset that combines interviews and physical examinations to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. This project aims to leverage this data to provide insights into the distribution of various health metrics, the correlation between nutritional intake and health outcomes, and trends in the prevalence of certain diseases over time. By employing advanced statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to not only describe the current state of health in the U.S. but also to predict future trends and identify areas for intervention.

## Methodology
* Data Exploration:  Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify potential predictors and outliers in health metrics such as BMI, cholesterol levels, and nutritional intake.
* Statistical Tests: Utilized t-tests and F-tests to identify significant variables that contribute to the detection of outliers in health metrics. Check for Multicollinearity.
* Model Fitting: Selected anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or DBSCAN suitable for identifying outliers in multi-dimensional data.
* Model Comparison: Used metrics like F1-score, precision, and recall to evaluate the performance of different anomaly detection models.
  
## Key Findings


##  R Code and Libraries Used
* R Version: 4.3.1
* Libraries: tidyverse, DataExplorer, car, solitude, e1071, fpc, caret, MASS, tuneRanger, mlr 

## Future Work
Exhaust different algorithmic approaches to fine tuning the model for the multi-dimensional data.
